# GC-Content Calculator 

## Description 
* Tool for calculating and plotting the GC content of one or multiple sequences taken in as user input. 
* User can choose between calculating total GC content of each sequence or performing sliding window analysis (SWAN) for the calculation of the GC content for each window,
  to reveal patterns of variability along nucleotide sequences.

## Outputs
* Single sequence / Simple calculation    : Floating point number
* Single sequence / SWAN                  : Simple line plot
* Multiple sequences / Simple calculation : Barplot
* Multiple sequences / SWAN               : Line plot with multiple y values

## Libraries
- matplotlib
- biopython
